# Expert Based Credit Scoring Model

*Karimi Gitari (November 2022)*


## Overview

Starting a digital lending company requires an expert scoring model before getting actual costomer data that is used to tune the expert model or phase it out and build a databased model. An expert based model is very risky and should be focused on lending the minimum amount posible as a means of buying actual customer data. Subsequent loan amounts an be gradually increased depending on customer repayment behavior. From the total funding available , the lender is advised to determine the amount they are willing to spend on buying customer data , establish a maximum amount they are willing to lend to each customer and tune the expert model so that it approves a maximum of 30% of that amount to the best customer scored. 10% of default should be assumed and planned for.

## Data Sources
* Customer Application Forms
* Financial Information from Telco's/ Banks
* Credit Reference Bureau 

## Data Points / Variables
* Customer Application Forms
  * Employment Status
  * Level of Education
  * Number of Dependants
 
It is important to collect as much customer demographic information as posible (gender , age , marital status , location...etc). While these variables aren't used during expert scoring , they will be correlated with loan repayments and help build the databased subsequent model
